median of array of 10: the 5th element

median of array of 5: 3nd element

median of array of size 15? the 8th element (index 7)

we want to find an element that is greater than 7 other elements.
start by finding m1 in array1 and m2 in array2.

m1 = index 4,5
m2 = index 3

search for m1 in array2. we know its final index would be 4.5 + index_in_m2
search for m2 in array1, we know its final index would be 3 + index_in_m1
if either total index = 7, we are done. if m1 total index > 7, that means that we have to search in array1 from 0..m1. 
if m1 total index < 7, that means we have to search in array1 from m1..end

if m2 total index < 7... etc

now let m1 = median(0..m1) and m2 = median(0..m2)





lets define a function f(x). we are searching for f(x) = y.
we can do a binary search on the input range of x until we find the value where
f(x) = y

f(x) would be the number of elements < array[x] in both arrays. costs lg(n) + lg(m) time.
do a binary search on X range, eliminating half the possibilities at every step. 

lg(a*b) = lg(a) + lg(b). easy example: log(10) + log(100) = 1 + 2 = 3 = log(100 * 10) = log(1000) = 3
lg(a/b) = lg(a) - lg(b)
