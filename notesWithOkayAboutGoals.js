List of topics from oky:

x data structures
* web dev
* programming languages
* systems design
* systems programming
* operating systems
* networking
* app building
* databases

Idea: put together a monthly set of goals

//systems programming
* accessing files
* traversing the file system
* reading bytes

// NETWORKING

* learn how to open sockets and talk to other servers
* learn about the basics of the protocol stack: 5 or 7 layer model: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model

//OPERATING SYSTEMS

* Learn basic model of a computer: RAM + HD + CPU + peripherals
* Multi-threading (mutexes, semaphores, etc)
* Processes & Interprocess communication (IPC)
* RAM / VRAM
* CPU Scheduling

// APP BUILDING:

Be able to start an app from scratch quickly. F.E. someone asks you to build tic-tac-toe game or simple React app, should be able to get a UI / webserver up and running within a day

// WEB DEV

Web Development tooling? (Webpack, grunt, babel)
What is there outside of unit testing? Integration and E2E testing
Implement a web store like Redux (to understand it)
Front-End Optimizations

D3 visualizations (or nvd3)
I still need to check out Typescript
Learn a little bit about JWT and Oauth
Check out GraphQL
Learn common design patterns (MVC & MVVM) but more interested in patterns for back end design

// BACKEND / DEPLOYMENT

Learn cloud basics like what a (VPC is in AWS and why it is beneficial, reverse proxy)
Learn about different webservers like (apache vs nginx)
Learn about differences between a task queue and a message queue(reddis vs rabbitMQ) 

Databases (don't know anything at all) Maybe get a basic understanding and build a project with Postgres and another with Mongo and make sure I understand both. 
Learn SQL language and how to make simple queries: SELECT, CREATE / ALTER TABLE, etc
Learn what an ORM is and how to use them. 
           
Still don't know what Docker & Kubernetes is...    
           
SUPER IMPORTANT( I need to pick up another back end language) maybe Go?
           
Understand what automation tools do (salt stack, chef, ansible, teraform)

// Misc.

Regular Expressions
Learn about high level system design. 
Some Theory on Distributed systems and the tools used in the industry

// Project Brainstorm

* A site like outline.com that uses a crawler to load a page and bypass its firewall: would use backend concepts like task queue and databases
* A graphing calculator (good project for a simple React app?)
* text editor + text replay (picking a web editor like Ace or Codemirror and adding replay by saving the history to server), involves DBs and Sockets
